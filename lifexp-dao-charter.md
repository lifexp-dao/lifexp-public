## 3. Governance

* Token holders (XP tokens) may propose and vote on:

  * Feature roadmap priorities
  * DAO treasury allocations
  * Provider onboarding/verification criteria
  * Protocol upgrades

## 4. Smart Contract Layer

* Core DAO logic is governed by Ethereum smart contracts deployed at:

  * `XPToken.sol` contract address: `0x...`
  * Other governance contracts TBD

* All legal documents (Articles of Organization, IP filings, DAO operating policies) are open and versioned in the LifeXP GitHub repository.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

LifeXP DAO LLC is not responsible for actions taken by independent members unless such actions are explicitly authorized by a DAO-wide vote or formal agreement.
