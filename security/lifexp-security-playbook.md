## 🛡 DAO Security Best Practices

* All DAO legal and filing statuses are monitored **ONLY via official portals (e.g., USPTO TSDR)**.
* No DAO action will be taken based on emails alone unless verified through official portals or DAO multisig governance.
* DAO treasury interactions are **limited to verified multisig addresses**.
* ENS name (`lifexp.eth`) is the official on-chain identity of the DAO and must be validated before responding to requests.
